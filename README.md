<!-- ![The Glowing Tube](readme/header.jpg) -->

## What is this project?

An LED strip system which can be used to light up your home or set the right mood at a house party. Multiple Glowing Tubes can be connected to the same control unit, to make it easy to control them all, via the WLED app, web interface or via physical buttons.

How does one control the LED animations, you ask? By accessing the "Glowing Core" interface via your web browser or WLED app for iOS and Android. "The Glowing Core" is a tiny hardware package to control LED strips by the way - and used inside "The Glowing Tube". [Check out the readme](https://github.com/glowingkitty/TheGlowingCore) to learn more about that project.
